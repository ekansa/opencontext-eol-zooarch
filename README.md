Open Context GitHub Data Repository for EOL Zooarch

This repository has data relating to the the EOL computable data challenge project. 
The project involves Linked Data anotation and publication of zooarchaeological data from 
Epipaleolithic - Neolthic sites in Anatolia. For semantic annotation, Open Context 
editors linked data to the Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org),
UBERON (http://uberon.org), and a Zooarchaeology specific ontology maintained by Open Context
(http://opencontext.org/vocabularies/open-context-zooarch).

The directory "Integrated-Datasets" includes data aligned to various controlled vocabularies and shared conventions to
facilitate comparison across projects. Datasets include additional metadata, including chronological (date ranges),
and geospatial information as well as other annotations supplied by Open Context editors to facilitate
interoperability.

The directory "Project-Datasets" includes data as described by the contributing zooarchaeologists,
subject to editorial cleanup. 

Use the Open Context URI as the "primary key" to relate these data
with data in other tables or other sources. Web URIs provide additional related data including links to data
documentation and definitions of vocabulary terms. The first row of each CSV file has the field names.
